## üí¨ How to Use the AI Assistant

### For Users:

1. **Open Chat:**
   - Click the sparkle icon (‚ú®) in the top navigation
   - Chat panel slides in from the right

2. **Ask Questions:**
   ```
   "Create a beginner workout plan for building muscle"
   "Suggest exercises for abs"
   "Schedule a cardio workout for tomorrow"
   "What's a good warm-up routine?"
   ```

3. **AI Creates Data:**
   - When you ask to create/schedule workouts
   - AI automatically saves to database
   - You'll see confirmation messages
   - Data appears in your workouts/schedule pages

### Example Interactions:

**Example 1: Create Workout Plan**
```
User: "Create a 30-minute beginner strength training workout"

AI: [Creates workout in database]
    "I've created a '30-Minute Beginner Strength Training' workout plan for you!
    
    This workout includes:
    - Warm-up (5 min)
    - Bodyweight squats
    - Push-ups
    - Lunges
    - Plank holds
    - Cool-down (5 min)
    
    The workout has been saved to your library. You can view it in the Workouts tab!"
```

**Example 2: Schedule Workout**
```
User: "Schedule a cardio session for tomorrow at 7 AM"

AI: [Creates scheduled workout in database]
    "I've scheduled a cardio workout for 2025-11-01 at 07:00!
    You can view it in your Schedule tab."
```

**Example 3: Get Advice**
```
User: "How do I improve my running endurance?"

AI: "Great question! Here are some tips to improve running endurance:
    
    1. Progressive Overload: Gradually increase your distance...
    2. Interval Training: Incorporate HIIT workouts...
    3. Consistency: Aim for 3-4 runs per week...
    4. Cross-Training: Swimming or cycling on off days...
    5. Proper Nutrition: Fuel before long runs..."
```

### Security:

1. **API Route Protection:**
   - Validates user ID
   - Uses service role for database operations
   - Checks environment variables

2. **Database Security:**
   - Uses Supabase service role (bypasses RLS for admin operations)
   - All operations tagged with userId
   - Users can only affect their own data

3. **AI Safety:**
   - Temperature set to 0.7 (balanced creativity/accuracy)
   - System prompt guides behavior
   - Tool execution has error handling
