## 💪 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Data Relationships

**Solution:** Implemented optimistic updates with proper error handling and data refetching strategies. Used React's useEffect hooks efficiently to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Challenge 4: Calendar Implementation
**Problem:** Building a custom workout calendar with date handling and state management  
**Solution:** Used date-fns library for reliable date operations and created a custom calendar grid component. Implemented efficient filtering and caching to handle large datasets smoothly.
